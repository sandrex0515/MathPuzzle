# Sandrex Math Puzzle (Python)

A simple puzzle console app.
 
This project is for MaroonStudios Coding Puzzle Exam

#Approach

This is the first time i tried python, i guess this language is easy to learn it is slightly similar to PHP OOP.
I think an hour on how do i build a puzzle. i have no idea how puzzle works in the first place.
I searched videos on youtube how to puzzle works i found some math puzzle so i decided i will automate this puzzle,
Then i study python in w3school.

#Run in Console

First open this project to IDE. (Im using PyCharm and pyton 3.7).


#Input and output

Run the MathPuzzle.py and then guess or solve the missing number.
Input the answer per row:

First row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the first row)
Second row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the second row)
third row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the third row).

#That's all thank you I have fun coding this.
