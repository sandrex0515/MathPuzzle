# Sandrex Math Puzzle (Python)

A simple puzzle console app.
 
This project is for MaroonStudios Coding Puzzle Exam

# Approach

This is the first time i tried python, i guess this language is easy to learn it is slightly similar to PHP OOP.
I think an hour on how do i build a puzzle. i have no idea how puzzle works in the first place.
I searched videos on youtube how do puzzle works i found some math puzzle so i decided that i will automate this puzzle,
Then i study python in w3school.

# Limitation

The application is only a console and the program will not loop. 

# Run in Console

First open this project to IDE. (Im using PyCharm and pyton 3.7).
if you are not using python v3 kindly change the input to raw_input

# Input and output

Run the MathPuzzle.py and then guess or solve the missing number.
Input the answer per row:

First row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the first row)

Second row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the second row)

third row answer: (Input your guess or answer number here for the third row).

OUTPUT
The correct answer will be shown on the 4th row after you input.


If you want to get right answer... every row is equal to 10 just minus 
the two rows and that is the answer. * sample 1 ? 5 = 1 4 5 = 10.

# That's all thank you I had fun coding this.
